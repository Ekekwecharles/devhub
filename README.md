Challenge:
Describe the problem the Portfolio Project is intended to solve.
This is an online directory for developers to create a profile and share their work. You can search for the developers based on their name, technologies you are interested in like django, node.js php etc, based on projects(maybe you are looking for a specific project, application or game) You can see all their projects, access their skills, see their ratings, users review and bio. When you find a developer that matches your specifics you can also send them a message to reach out to them. Employers can also use this app to screen developers easily.
